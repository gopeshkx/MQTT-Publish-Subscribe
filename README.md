# MQTT-Publish-Subscribe
 Python MQTT Publish and Subscribe
This is a script to publish to a topic, and then receive the published message.

Code Explanation:

I use the time.sleep() function to insert delays so as to give the client time to connect etc.

I publish and subscribe using the same client.
